# nodemcu_remote_temp_sensor
Simple design of a remote wireless Temperature and Humidity Sensor whose data can be accessed wirelessly through Blynk mobile application from any location.

Code is written using Arduino syntax.
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor was used to log the temperature readings in degree celcius and Humidity readings as %.
The DHT11 power pin was connected to 3v of the NodeMCU, Ground was connected to Ground of NodeMCU and Data Pin connected to Pin D4 of node MCU.

Blynk Application was used for remote data viewing and monitoring.
